# t-channel_dark_QCD
UFO files for a QCD like dark sector with and t-channel mediator

This repository contains the UFO files and respective feynrules models for the generation of semi-visible and/or emerging jets via a bi-fundamental mediator. For details on the model see e.g. [1502.05409](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1345350), [2011.13990](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1834020),  2409.XXXX. Degenerate dark quark masses are assumed and the basis is chosen so that only the first three generations of dark quarks couple to SM quarks via the mediator. Thus, only three dark quarks are implemented, though additional dark quarks can be added analogously in the feynrule models. Fourth and higher generation dark quarks are produced during shower and can be implemented using the HiddenValley module of pythia (> 8.226).
